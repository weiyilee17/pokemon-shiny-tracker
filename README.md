## What's this app about?

This is an app used to keep track of progress of shiny pokemons captured in the switch game `Pokemon Let's Go Eevee` and `Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu`, since there is no intuitive way of doing so in game. The main purpose is to get more experience with the T3 Stack for real problems, and practice drizzle.

pnpm has backward compatability issue for v8 -> v9. Namely, the lock file version from v6 -> v9. For pnpm versions upgraded to v9 and above, after pulling the latest code, reinstalling the dependencies would fix the issue of failling to start the app.
